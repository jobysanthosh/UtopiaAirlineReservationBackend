# Utopia Airline Reservation Backend

This is the Reservation microservice for the Utopia Airlines application. In this part of the project I used Node.js to define the API's needed for a user to book a ticket. For CI/CD for this microservice I used AWS Code Pipeline to pull from the master branch of this repository. I learned how to create a Node.js application with Express, how to use callbacks to make all the ajax calls asynchronous and how to use AWS Code Pipeline.
